# Dictionary
 The Dictionary App is a frontend web project created with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, designed to offer quick word definitions. Users input words, and the app fetches their meanings from an API, presenting them in a user-friendly format. This app operates solely on the client side, without any backend processing, ensuring simplicity and accessibility
